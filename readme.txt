+++ MOD TOOLS 1.3 (incremental) +++



Installation:

- Unzip the .zip file to a new folder.

- You will see three folders; "map_source", "raw", and "zone_source".

- Highlight all three folders and copy them into your "Call of Duty - World at War" root game directory.

- You will be asked if it is okay to overwrite folders and files. Click "Yes to All" for this operation and any subsequent requests.


You have now successfully installed Mod Tools 1.3.


Below you will find a list of the updated files included with Mod Tools 1.3. This package has over 2800 assets to help you create your own Shi No Numa-style levels in conjunction with Patch 1.5.
